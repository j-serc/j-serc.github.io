## Manifesto

The Virtual Software Engineering Research Community Conference
(VSERC) provides an international forum for the publication of high-quality scholarly articles and artefacts in all areas of software engineering. All published papers and artefacts are freely available online. Thus, JSER is a diamond access journal with no article processing costs (APC) for authors and no access costs for readers.

We are a continuing series, submission dates every two months:

- First day of even months: submission;
- Last day of even months:
if papers have not attracted two reviewers,
they are
are returned to authors so that they can change the paper and/or
submit elsewhere.
- Last day of odd months:
papers are marked accept=True or accept=False
by last day of the odd month). 
  -  Papers that marked
accept=False can be submitted (at the authors' discretion).

## Process

- VSERC is a trusted preprint review team.
- VSERC works in partnership  with print venues (e.g. journals).
  - We offer fast review times (2 months or less)
    and they offer publication.
  - Meanwhile, the pre-prints accpted  by VSERC are available
    on-line, so the community can access high quality research
    results, very quickly.

# Details:

- Authors write preprints and post them to Zenodo (so that
  preprint is now on-line)
- Once we accept a paper, authors should then send  that
  paper to some other print venue (a journal or a conference) 
  along with the reviews generated here.
- That venues then accepts that paper (in just a few days),
  based  on our reviews.
- VSERC reviews small to medium sized papers (4 to 20 pages).
  Papers can be a traditional report of a research reesult i
  but also vision statements, errrata, a tools tutorial,
  a statement of research direction, etc.
- The type of papers reviewed here can be adjust by authors.
  - When submitting papers, authors can select the criteria by
  which their paper will be reviewed.
  - If no such criteria meets their needs, authors can propose
    edits to existing standards or even new standards. 
  - These
    edits are then reviwed by our editorial board.
- Authors then send us the pair (paper, criteria). 

## Why VSERC?

“Be the change we wish to see in the world.” --Gandi.

“Ideas are born free; and everywhere they are  in chains”.-- with
apologies to Jean-Jacques Rousseau


We seek a broader range of research types.
We seek more control of the reviewing process,
freed from the constraints of decade old reviewing standards.
We need to remove ourselves from standard methods seen in
existing journals.  Our editorial managers  are based on decades-old
publication models. These tools are be easily replaced and improved
by freely-available open source
alternatives--
thus allowing
more experimentation and faster evolution of how we share science
in SE.
